            Prior to MD Transportation, LLC, our owner, Mr. Mumed drove school buses for Minneapolis Public Schools for
            15 years before founding his own transportation company. His extensive experience behind the wheel gives him
            a valued perspective in ensuring that drivers are punctual and professional.

            MDâ€™s director of operations, Waday Musse, started driving a school bus for First Student in 2007 and still
            drives for MD. His focus is safety, having never had an accident.

            We know that drivers are the face of the school and that a successful day at school starts with a
            problem-free bus ride. A well-trained and experienced driver can reliably produce safe rides while
            addressing behavioral issues and driving conditions. We train our drivers to always provide safe and
            efficient transportation services. Parents and teachers alike can expect timely pick-ups and dropoffs, day
            in and day out.
